Feel free to copy and use this code for use in your own projects, though I definietly recomend watching the videos for context, and, more importantly, the oppurtunity to build these programs step-by-step. You won't have to worry about copying anyone's code if you learn how to write it youerself! 

Everything here is for educational purposes only.
